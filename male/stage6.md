# **Analysis Report Based on Hamilton-Norwood Scale (For Males)**  

### **Hair Loss Stage: Hamilton-Norwood Stage 6**  

### **Stage Description:**  
At **Stage 6**, hair loss is **extensive**. The **frontal and crown bald areas have merged**, leaving little to no hair on the **top and crown of the head**. The **remaining hair forms a horseshoe pattern**, leaving hair only on the sides and back of the head.  

At this stage, **hair transplant is the only effective solution** for hair restoration, along with scalp micropigmentation (SMP) as an alternative for those who don‚Äôt want surgery.  

### **Possible Causes:**  
- **Genetic Predisposition** (Family history of baldness)  
- **DHT Sensitivity** (Hair follicles are completely miniaturized and no longer grow hair)  
- **Aging & Hormonal Changes** (Testosterone conversion to DHT increases with age)  
- **Stress & Poor Lifestyle Choices** (Unhealthy diet, smoking, excessive alcohol)  
- **Nutritional Deficiencies** (Lack of biotin, iron, zinc, Vitamin D)  

### **Recommended Treatments:**  

üîπ **Non-Surgical Treatments (To Strengthen Remaining Hair & Post-Transplant Care):**  
‚úÖ **Minoxidil 5% (Topical Solution):** Can help in maintaining hair in the donor area.  
‚úÖ **Finasteride (1mg daily) (Under Doctor‚Äôs Guidance):** Slows further thinning of remaining hair.  
‚úÖ **PRP Therapy (Platelet-Rich Plasma):** Helps improve post-transplant hair growth.  
‚úÖ **DHT Blockers (Natural Supplements):** Green tea, saw palmetto, pumpkin seed oil.  
‚úÖ **Nutritional Support:** Iron, biotin, omega-3, and zinc-rich diet/supplements.  

üîπ **Surgical Treatment (Hair Transplant - Highly Recommended):**  
At **Stage 6**, hair transplant is **the only way to restore a full head of hair**.  

‚úÖ **Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE):** Individual grafts are extracted from the donor area (back of the scalp) and implanted into the bald regions.  
‚úÖ **Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT):** A strip of hair is removed from the back of the scalp and implanted into bald areas (best for higher density).  
‚úÖ **Combination Approach (FUE + FUT):** Many patients at this stage require **4500-6000 grafts** for full coverage.  
‚úÖ **Body Hair Transplant (BHT):** If scalp donor hair is insufficient, hair from the beard or chest may be used.  
‚úÖ **Scalp Micropigmentation (SMP):** If a hair transplant is not possible, SMP creates a shaved-head look for a fuller appearance.  

**Which treatment is best?**  
- If the **donor area has sufficient hair**, a **hair transplant (FUE/FUT) is ideal**.  
- If **donor hair is limited**, a **combination of scalp + body hair transplant** may be needed.  
- If **transplant is not an option**, **scalp micropigmentation (SMP) offers a non-surgical alternative**.  

### **Future Hair Loss Prediction:**  
Without treatment, **Stage 6 may progress to Stage 7**, leading to **complete baldness on top**, leaving only a thin strip of hair on the sides and back. A **timely hair transplant ensures a fuller and more natural-looking result**.  

### **Expert Advice:**  
At **Stage 6**, a **hair transplant is the best option** to restore a natural look. Since **more grafts are required**, it is best to consult a specialist for a customized plan.
