# **Analysis Report Based on Hamilton-Norwood Scale (For Males)**  

### **Hair Loss Stage: Hamilton-Norwood Stage 1**  

### **Stage Description:**  
At this stage, there is minimal to no visible hair loss. The hairline is intact with no significant recession at the temples or crown. Some individuals might notice very slight thinning near the temples, but it is not a cause for concern.  

### **Possible Causes:**  
- **Genetic predisposition** (Family history of baldness)  
- **Hormonal changes** (DHT sensitivity beginning)  
- **Lifestyle & Stress Factors** (Poor sleep, unhealthy diet, stress)  
- **Nutritional Deficiencies** (Lack of protein, iron, biotin, and vitamins)  

### **Recommended Treatments:**  
Since the hair loss is not yet significant, this is the best time for **preventive care**:  
‚úÖ **Healthy Diet:** Increase intake of protein, iron, and omega-3 fatty acids.  
‚úÖ **Scalp Care:** Use mild, sulfate-free shampoos and avoid excessive heat styling.  
‚úÖ **Minoxidil 2% or 5% (Optional):** Can be considered for strengthening hair.  
‚úÖ **DHT Blockers (Natural):** Green tea, pumpkin seed oil, and saw palmetto may help.  
‚úÖ **PRP Therapy (Preventive):** Platelet-Rich Plasma therapy can improve scalp health and strengthen hair roots.  

### **Future Hair Loss Prediction:**  
If proper care is not taken, **Stage 1 may progress to Stage 2 or beyond**, leading to gradual temple recession and thinning. Genetic factors and lifestyle play a significant role.  

### **Expert Advice:**  
At this stage, **early intervention** can completely stop or slow down hair loss. We recommend **scalp analysis every 6-12 months** and a **customized hair care routine** to prevent progression.
