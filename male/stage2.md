# **Analysis Report Based on Hamilton-Norwood Scale (For Males)**  

### **Hair Loss Stage: Hamilton-Norwood Stage 2**  

### **Stage Description:**  
At **Stage 2**, there is **mild hairline recession**, mainly at the **temples**, forming an “M” shape. The hair loss is still minimal and not very noticeable, but slight thinning may be observed at the frontal region. The **crown remains unaffected** at this stage.  

### **Possible Causes:**  
- **Genetic predisposition** (Family history of hair loss)  
- **Hormonal changes** (Increased DHT sensitivity affecting hair follicles)  
- **Lifestyle & Stress Factors** (Work pressure, poor sleep, smoking, alcohol)  
- **Nutritional Deficiencies** (Low protein, iron, biotin, Vitamin D)  

### **Recommended Treatments:**  
At this stage, hair loss can still be **controlled and reversed** with proper treatment:  

✅ **Minoxidil 5% (Topical Solution):** Helps improve hair density and regrowth.  
✅ **Finasteride (1mg daily) (Optional, after doctor's consultation):** Blocks DHT to prevent further hair loss.  
✅ **PRP Therapy (Platelet-Rich Plasma):** Stimulates hair follicles and strengthens weak hair.  
✅ **DHT Blockers (Natural & Supplementary):** Green tea, saw palmetto, pumpkin seed oil.  
✅ **Nutritional Support:** Increase iron, zinc, and biotin intake through diet or supplements.  
✅ **Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT):** Helps in hair regrowth by improving scalp blood circulation.  

### **Future Hair Loss Prediction:**  
Without treatment, **Stage 2 can progress to Stage 3**, leading to more noticeable temple recession and potential early crown thinning. **Early intervention is key** to maintaining hair density.  

### **Expert Advice:**  
At this stage, **non-surgical treatments** work effectively. We recommend **starting Minoxidil and PRP therapy** to maintain hair health and prevent progression.
